# JARCC_MiniATMSystem

JARCC is an ATM system named after its developers, offering financial services with five transaction options: deposit, withdraw, transfer funds, change pin, and exit. It supports two account types: savings and checking.

Upon starting, users are greeted and asked to enter their name and PIN. They can choose to view the terms and conditions. Afterward, the system displays the user's name and PIN before showing the transaction menu.

Deposit: Users select an account, view the balance, and deposit at least 100 pesos. The new balance is then displayed.

Withdraw: Users select an account, view the balance, and withdraw at least 500 pesos. The new balance is shown, or an error message appears if the balance is insufficient.

Transfer Funds: Users transfer at least 1000 pesos between accounts. The system updates and displays the balances of both accounts.

Change Pin: Users can set a new PIN, which must meet specific digit-only criteria.

Exit: Users can leave the system by selecting the exit option.
